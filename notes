 - add discovery to oj app

 - ReadSEN
  - maybe optional arg that handles expanding or shortening buffer
   - expand when last char reached
   - condense after successful callback
   - maybe interface for expand and condense should also has cb for []byte or rather an add-on interface
    - better separate to allow for easier reuse without forcing a new type
   - readMore(buf []byte, start, i int) ([]byte, int, int)
    - when end reached
     - if start is 0 then slide
     - expand buf
     - read into space then shorten if needed (eof)



---------

- pretty
 - align maps as well as arrays

- unit tests and example for cmd/oj

- optimize unmarshal
 - direct parse to struct

----------------

- option to detect duplicate keys or make part of validator
 - change stack to include array and map or maybe just map and nil means array
  - check performance hit
  - check added condition of whether keys should be checked. If too high then copy code
 - or separate stack in func for key maps along with dip code

-------------

- Match a JavaScript regular expression. For example, [?(@.description =~ /cat.*/i)]
- Exists syntax? [?(@.x exists)]
