- parse
 - add discover option to find JSON or SEN in a string or file
  - 3 states
   - DiscoverOff
   - DiscoverAny
   - DiscoverSets - only discover {} and []
  - starting map/mode is like value but no errors on invalid
   - same as value but replace errChar with a skip or skip and drop to drop current
    - if number then cb and drop
  - errors don't panic but close off current (if whole) and then back to discover maps
 - implement on all parsers
 - sen.Discover(b []byte, optimistic bool, f func(v any))
 - fast scan to identify block
  - look for { or [
  - then count up and down matching on {} []
   - detect start and end of " and ', skipping escaped
  - if much faster then parse in separater channel
  - handles embedded json
   - maybe faster in some cases
  - maybe a optimistic mode that assumes json/sen so count and minimal modes
   - regular mode - attempt parse, if fails then try next


- embedded struct pointer encoding issue
- json.Unmarshaler
 - use alt.Recompose and convert simple to bytes and pass to unmarshaller

- pretty
 - align maps as well as arrays

- unit tests and example for cmd/oj

- optimize unmarshal
 - direct parse to struct

----------------

- option to detect duplicate keys or make part of validator
 - change stack to include array and map or maybe just map and nil means array
  - check performance hit
  - check added condition of whether keys should be checked. If too high then copy code
 - or separate stack in func for key maps along with dip code

-------------

- Match a JavaScript regular expression. For example, [?(@.description =~ /cat.*/i)]
- Exists syntax? [?(@.x exists)]

---------

- test for Recompose with anonymous embeded struct
