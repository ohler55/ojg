- next/todo
 - regex op =~
  - /^xyz&/
 - SEN
  - writer
  - benchmarks
 - cmd/oj
  - read args from file (FIN format)
   - also check ~/.oj.fin or ~/.oj - graphql emacs mode works well
  - palette in cfg file
  - build or restructure json
   - use a template based approach along with JSONPath
- advanced ops
 - in - a in [1,2,3]
 - exists, empty, or has
 - size or length - [?(@.x size > 3)] or [?(size @.x > 3)]
-------------
- cmd/oj
  -colors list of colors or maybe map?
   -p (palette) key=red
   -key red

 - Minimal Encoding System
 - spec
  - aspects of JSON and GraphQL
  - keys or any value does not need quotes unless they have syntax or space characters
  - space or characters to ignore are space and below as well comma
  - { starts object which is closed by }
  - [ starts object which is closed by ]
  - : separates key from value
  - " or ' allowed
  - \n in string is okay
  - \ is the escape character
  - # comments are allowed
  - all JSON types but also time
 - parser to simple
 - writer
 - spec page in /docs/fin_spec.md

- generally follow graphql description
 - unicode encodes as utf-8 (BOM ok)
 - whitespace
  - <= 0x20 (09, 0A, 0D, 20 ok, others deprecated but ignored except 00 which terminates
   - 0A terminates comment
  - comma
 - token
   - any non space and non punc
 - punctuation
  - [ ] { } : " ' \ #
 - values
  - string
   - escape characters ok including \uhhhh \Uhhhhhhhh
  - number
  - true false null
  - array
  - object

------------------

- Match a JavaScript regular expression. For example, [?(@.description =~ /cat.*/i)]
- Exists syntax? [?(@.x exists)]

-----------------------------------
- parse methods attempted
 - tried functions instead of switch, slower
  - tried array of 256 functions for value switching
 - all in one function is fastest
 - col++ created overhead as well
