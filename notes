----------------

- combine for performance, maybe
 - how about just adding to num
  - need a validation version or flag

- cmd/oj
 - set option
  - |$.foo|| for delete
  - |$.foo|{"x":1}| for replace/set
  - |$.foo|@.bar| for set from within
  - eval in order
  - use any char as separator
  - also jp.Expr.Set(jp.Expr)
   - find with first path and replace with path arg relative to found

 - regex op =~
  - /^xyz&/
 - in addition to parse callback support chan for results
 - cmd/oj
  - read args from file (SEN format)
   - also check ~/.oj.fin or ~/.oj - graphql emacs mode works well
  - palette in cfg file
  - build or restructure json
   - use a template based approach along with JSONPath
- advanced ops
 - in - a in [1,2,3]
 - exists, empty, or has
 - size or length - [?(@.x size > 3)] or [?(size @.x > 3)]
-------------
- cmd/oj
  -colors list of colors or maybe map?
   -p (palette) key=red
   -key red

------------------

- Match a JavaScript regular expression. For example, [?(@.description =~ /cat.*/i)]
- Exists syntax? [?(@.x exists)]
