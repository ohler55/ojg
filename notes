- discover package
 - must handle key like "abc"x: as an error
  - pop on end quote should go to colonMap, maybe pre-load in modes
   - maybe a keyQuoteChar in senPreKeyMap
   - or maybe always preload colonMap and terminate key with a pop
    - need to deal with } though, maybe pop until ??? dummy map marker for objects start or just senPreKey

 - discover.SEN(b []byte, f func(v any) bool)
  - use Find and then parse, if err then backup
 - discover.JSON(b []byte, f func(v any) bool)
 - discover.Read(r io.Reader, cb func(b []byte) (bacup, stop bool))
 - discover.ReadSEN(r io.Reader, f func(v any) bool)
 - discover.ReadJSON(r io.Reader, f func(v any) bool)

 - use FindSEN and FindJSON instead of bare Find

 - add discovery to oj app

 - ReadSEN
  - maybe optional arg that handles expanding or shortening buffer
   - expand when last char reached
   - condense after successful callback
   - maybe interface for expand and condense should also has cb for []byte or rather an add-on interface
    - better separate to allow for easier reuse without forcing a new type

---------

- pretty
 - align maps as well as arrays

- unit tests and example for cmd/oj

- optimize unmarshal
 - direct parse to struct

----------------

- option to detect duplicate keys or make part of validator
 - change stack to include array and map or maybe just map and nil means array
  - check performance hit
  - check added condition of whether keys should be checked. If too high then copy code
 - or separate stack in func for key maps along with dip code

-------------

- Match a JavaScript regular expression. For example, [?(@.description =~ /cat.*/i)]
- Exists syntax? [?(@.x exists)]
